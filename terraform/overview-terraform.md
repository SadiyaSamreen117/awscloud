## Terraform 

Terraform is an open source infrastructure as a code (IaC) tool.

## What is Iac ?
 
Tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.

IaC allows you to build,change and manage your infrastructure in a safe,consistent and repeatable way by defining resource configuration that you can version,reuse and share.
