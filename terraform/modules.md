# Modules 

A module in Terraform is a container for multiple resources that are used together. It is a way to organize and reuse code for managing infrastructure. Every Terraform configuration is part of a moduleâ€”even a simple configuration in a single `.tf`file is a module (called the root module).

1. Key Functions of a module

- Encapsulation: Groups related resources logically.
- Reusability: Allows you to reuse common configurations.
- Abstraction: Hides implementation details behind inputs and outputs.
- Scalability: Makes infrastructure easier to scale and manage.
